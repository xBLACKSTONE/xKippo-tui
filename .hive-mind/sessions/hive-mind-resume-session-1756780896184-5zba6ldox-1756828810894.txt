You are resuming a Hive Mind session with comprehensive context:

📋 SESSION DETAILS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📌 Session ID: session-1756780896184-5zba6ldox
📌 Swarm ID: swarm-1756780896181-2o9cm3geb
📌 Swarm Name: hive-1756780896130
🎯 Objective: Develop a text user interface log monitoring and management system for a cowrie honeypot. I plan to use this tool locally on the host running the cowrie honeypot. I want an advanced setup script that looks for common log locations and options for a security analyst. Please ensure this project is feature rich for a tui tool with lots of config options.

🎯 RESUMPTION PROTOCOL:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. **RESTORE CONTEXT**:
   - Review all checkpoint data and activity history above
   - Use mcp__claude-flow__memory_usage to retrieve collective memory
   - Check agent statuses and reassign tasks if needed
   - Verify all in-progress tasks are still valid

2. **CONTINUE EXECUTION**:
   - Resume in-progress tasks with their assigned agents
   - Process pending tasks based on priority (CRITICAL > HIGH > NORMAL > LOW)
   - Maintain agent coordination through memory sharing
   - Update progress tracking after each task completion

3. **COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:
   - Use mcp__claude-flow__memory_usage for all cross-agent communication
   - Apply consensus mechanisms for important decisions
   - Maintain swarm topology: unknown
   - Keep session checkpoint data updated regularly

4. **MEMORY CONTEXT**:
   - Session memory namespace: session-session-1756780896184-5zba6ldox
   - Swarm memory namespace: swarm-swarm-1756780896181-2o9cm3geb
   - Use these namespaces to access historical decisions and context

Resume the hive mind operation with full context awareness and continue working towards the objective.
